== How to build MiaouMod ==

Installation guide : https://wiki.piernov.org/en:miaoumod:installation

Be sure to install all the dependencies needed!
List: https://wiki.piernov.org/en:miaoumod:installation#required_dependencies

= Quick installation =

Make sure the script is marked as executable:
    chmod +x compile.sh
Then run it:
    ./compile.sh

Usage: ./compile.sh [--recompile] [--debug] — Build SuckerServ-v5
          --recompile   — Delete $COMPILEDIR (release_build or debug_build with --debug) before compiling SuckerServ again
          --debug       — Make a debug build

In case the compilation fails with memory allocation error, you can try to 
lower the number of threads used to compile by setting the THREADS variable.
For exemple:
    THREADS=1 ./compile.sh
